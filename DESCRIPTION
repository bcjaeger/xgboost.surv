Description: Gradient boosted decision trees are an excellent
  machine learning algorithm to develop prediction functions. 
  For analyses with censored outcomes, there are a number of 
  ways to leverage the popular and efficient R package 'xgboost'.
  The xgboost.surv package provides a framework to help you 
  engage with these types of risk prediction analyses using `xgboost`.
